    "\n",
    "When going through the GitHub page of a potential tech employee, it's important to assess their coding skills, work habits, and overall suitability for your team. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Contribution History:** by analyzing the number of \n",
    "   - commits -> `commit frequency`\n",
    "   - pull requests -> `pull request frequency`\n",
    "   - contributions made over time -> `lines of code contributed`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Quality of Code:** by using code analysis tools that generate metrics like\n",
    "   - cyclomatic complexity\n",
    "   - code duplication\n",
    "   - code coverage.\n",
    "   These tools can provide quantitative data on code maintainability, readability, and quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ~~**Problem-Solving Skills:** Assessing problem-solving skills statistically can be more challenging. One way is to evaluate the complexity and effectiveness of solutions they've implemented in their code, which can be measured using metrics like algorithmic efficiency.~~\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Collaboration:** Collaboration can be assessed by looking at the\n",
    " - number of pull requests\n",
    " - issues opened\n",
    " - contributions to other team members' projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Variety of Projects:** Statistically, can assess this by categorizing their repositories into different project types or technologies and calculating the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Use of Technologies:** Can measure this by identifying the programming languages and technologies they use in their repositories and quantifying their usage. The statistical representation might be in the form of a technology stack distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Project Completeness:** A bit more qualitative, but you can assess it by analyzing the commit and update history of their repositories.\n",
    "_Frequent updates, bug fixes, and improvements might indicate a commitment to project completion._\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Open Source Contributions:** Measure this statistically by evaluating the number and significance of contributions made to well-known open-source projects. The `reputation` and `impact` of these contributions can be quantified.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. ~~**Issue Management:** You can assess their responsiveness statistically by analyzing the time taken to address issues and the percentage of closed issues in their repositories.~~\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Documentation:** Assess the quality of documentation statistically by looking at the `length, clarity, and completeness of README files`, and potentially analyzing user feedback regarding documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. ~~**Version Control:** Measure this statistically by analyzing their use of Git, such as commit frequency, the number of branches, and the structure of their commit history.~~\n",
    "\n",
    "12. ~~**Learning and Growth:** This may be more challenging to measure statistically but can be inferred from the `update frequency of projects`, the adoption of new technologies, or the addition of new features.~~\n",
    "\n",
    "13. ~~**Coding Style Consistency:** You can measure this statistically by using code analysis tools that check adherence to coding style guides and report inconsistencies.~~\n",
    "\n",
    "14. ~~**Passion and Enthusiasm:** While difficult to measure directly, you can assess passion indirectly through the number and nature of contributions, as well as their engagement in relevant forums or communities.~~\n",
    "\n",
    "15. ~~**Adaptability:** Measuring adaptability statistically might involve looking at the variety of programming languages and frameworks they've used and assessing their proficiency in each based on quantitative criteria.~~\n"
